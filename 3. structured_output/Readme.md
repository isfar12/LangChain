# Structured Output with LangChain

This folder demonstrates three different approaches to getting structured output from LLMs using LangChain and Ollama models.

## Overview

Structured output is crucial for building reliable AI applications. Instead of parsing free-form text responses, you can enforce specific data formats that your application can reliably process.

## Three Approaches Covered

### 1. TypedDict (`1.typedict/`)

- Uses Python's `TypedDict` for basic type specification
- Simple dictionary-based structures
- Good for basic type hints and simple schemas

### 2. Pydantic (`2.pydantic/`)

- Uses Pydantic models for advanced validation
- Field constraints, default values, and data validation
- Rich type system with automatic validation
- **Most recommended approach**

### 3. JSON Schema (`3.json/`)

- Uses raw JSON Schema definitions
- Maximum flexibility for complex schemas
- Direct schema control

## Best Practices

1. **Use `llama3.1:8b` or `mistral:7b`** - These models handle structured output best
2. **Set low temperature** (0.1-0.3) for consistent formatting
3. **Start with Pydantic** - It provides the best balance of features and ease of use
4. **Be explicit in prompts** - Clearly state what structure you expect

## Model Recommendations

For structured output with Ollama:

- `llama3.1:8b` - Best overall performance
- `mistral:7b` - Good alternative
- `qwen2:7b` - Excellent instruction following
- `codellama:7b` - Good for JSON-like structures

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **Empty or malformed output**: Use more explicit prompts and lower temperature
- **Missing fields**: Make fields optional or provide defaults
- **Type errors**: Use proper validation with Pydantic
- **Inconsistent format**: Switch to a more reliable model like llama3.1*clear explanation** of **Structured Output in LangChain** with **simple analogies** to make it easy to grasp:

## 🌟 **What is Structured Output in LangChain?**

When you ask an AI a question, it usually replies with **free text** (like chatting with a friend).
But sometimes, you **don’t want just words** — you need the answer in a **specific, organized format** (like a JSON, table, or a checklist).

✅ **Structured Output** in LangChain means:

- Forcing the AI to reply in a **fixed format** (e.g., JSON, dictionary, list of objects).
- Making it easier for software to **read, store, or process** the response.

📌 **Analogy:**
Imagine you’re a chef (AI) taking orders from a waiter (LangChain).

- If you just “talk,” you might say: *“I’ll make a pizza with cheese, some olives, maybe mushrooms.”*
- But the restaurant POS system (your app) needs the order in a **structured format**:

```json
{
  "dish": "pizza",
  "toppings": ["cheese", "olives", "mushrooms"]
}
```

This way, the **kitchen staff and billing system** know exactly what to do.

## 🔧 **How Does LangChain Help?**

LangChain provides **tools** to make sure the AI **sticks to the structure**:

- **Output Parsers** → These tell the AI how the final response should “look.”
- **Schemas** → Define the “template” for answers (e.g., JSON with specific fields).
- **Validation** → Checks if the AI’s answer actually fits the structure.

📌 **Analogy:**
Think of LangChain like a **template in Google Forms**.

- The form **forces people to fill boxes** like Name, Email, and Age.
- No matter how they feel like writing, they must follow the **boxes you gave**.

## 🤖 **Why is This Important for Generative AI?**

Without structured output, AI might say:

> “The weather is sunny with a slight breeze, and the temperature feels like 26°C.”

But if your app expects **structured weather data**, that’s messy.

With structured output:

```json
{
  "temperature": 26,
  "condition": "sunny",
  "wind": "slight breeze"
}
```

✅ Easier for apps to:

- **Store in databases**
- **Use in dashboards**
- **Trigger other actions** (e.g., send an umbrella reminder if “rainy”)

📌 **Analogy:**
Like getting your **salary** — you don’t want your boss to hand you *“some money”*.
You want a **salary slip**: how much is **basic pay**, how much is **bonus**, how much is **tax**. That’s **structured**!

---

## 🏗 **How You Use It in LangChain**

1️⃣ **Define a schema** – tell LangChain what fields you want (e.g., name, age, city).
2️⃣ **Tell the AI** – “always reply in this structure.”
3️⃣ **Use an Output Parser** – LangChain checks the AI’s reply and “fixes” it if needed.

📌 **Example:**

```python
from langchain.output_parsers import StructuredOutputParser
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Define schema
schema = {
  "name": "string",
  "age": "integer",
  "city": "string"
}
```

The AI must **follow this schema** — like filling out a **government form**.

---

## 🎯 **Simple Takeaway**

- **Without structured output**: AI replies like a chatty friend.
- **With structured output**: AI replies like a **Google Sheet row** — neat, tidy, and ready for use.

📌 **Analogy:**
Think of **structured output** as putting AI answers into **labeled boxes** instead of dumping them into a bag. It’s easier to **find, use, and trust** the information.
